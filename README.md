# Python Functions Lab 🐍

## Overview
This lab provides hands-on practice with defining and calling functions in Python.  
It is designed for developers transitioning from JavaScript to Python and focuses on
building confidence with Python’s function syntax, parameters, return values, and
control flow.

The exercises are intentionally simple to encourage repetition and mastery of core
concepts.
